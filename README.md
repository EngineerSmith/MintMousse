# MintMousse
MintMousse is a web console for your Love project. Mint Mousse is fully customizable with different components and tabs that update in near real time. It has been designed to be as simple to use, and easy to build on if you wanted to add your own components.

## Quickstart
```
cd loveProject
git clone https://github.com/EngineerSmith/MintMousse --recurse-submodules libs/.
```
```lua
local mintMousse = require("libs.MintMousse")
-- to do write docs...
```
